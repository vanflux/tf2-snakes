# TF2 Snakes

![](resources/p2.png)

On September 16th, 2021, the TF2 developers released, without a doubt, the biggest, best and most glorious update ever, I was already giving up on TF2 as the bots were infesting all the servers, BUT thanks to one of the changes I won't go anymore, and the change was "Nature & Wildlife preservation measures" (at first it appeared to be nothing).

In this update 9 snakes in the water were added to the "snakewater" map (in the middle, the lake and the waterfall).
